## **Overall Project Description**  
This research explores **machine learning techniques** to address critical gaps in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) care, focusing on:  
- **Early Diagnosis**  
- **Progression Prediction**  
- **Attention Enhancement**  
- **Emotional Engagement**  

The integrated system leverages **parental questionnaires**, **video/image analysis**, real-time **emotion detection**, and **attention monitoring** to create a scalable, user-friendly platform for families and professionals. By combining **image processing**, **machine learning models**, and **real-time feedback mechanisms**, the project aims to:  
- Enhance diagnostic accuracy.  
- Improve developmental outcomes.  
- Provide actionable insights to caregivers.

## **Overall Research Problem**  
**Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)** diagnosis and care face significant challenges:  
- **Delayed or subjective evaluations.**  
- **Limited resources** for professional intervention.  
- **Lack of integrated tools** for monitoring progression and engagement.  

Early signs of ASD are often overlooked, progression tracking is challenging without expert intervention, and maintaining learning engagement remains problematic.  
This research develops a **comprehensive machine learning-based solution** to address these challenges with tools that are **objective**, **accessible**, and **reliable** for caregivers and professionals.

## **Main Objective**  
The primary objective of this research is to develop an **integrated machine-learning-based system** that addresses key challenges in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) care:  
1. **Diagnosis**: Enable early detection of ASD traits using parental questionnaires, video, and image analysis.  
2. **Progression Prediction**: Forecast developmental trends using behavioral patterns and historical data.  
3. **Attention Enhancement**: Monitor learning attention in real-time during interactive applications.  
4. **Engagement Improvement**: Use emotion detection to provide caregivers with actionable insights for better interactions.  

This **comprehensive approach** aims to improve developmental outcomes and enhance the quality of life for children with ASD.

## **Sub Objectives**  
- **Early Stage Detection**: Identifying ASD traits in infants through parental questionnaires and image analysis.  
- **Predicting Progression**: Forecasting future trends based on behavioral patterns and historical data.  
- **Attention-Enhancing Module**: Real-time monitoring of attention levels during learning activities.  
- **Advancing Autism Detection and Engagement**: Leveraging emotion detection to improve engagement.
